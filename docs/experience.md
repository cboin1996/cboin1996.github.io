## Roles üßë‚Äçüíº

The below sections provide short summaries of my roles over the years.

### AWS ‚òÅÔ∏è

#### Worldwide Proserve LCC

##### November 2022 - Present

###### Cloud Application Architect I

As a cloud application architect at AWS, I am responsible for gathering
customer requirements and building cloud applications that meet them.
I use the full power of AWS cloud to achieve this goal.
My work involves developing cloud applications
including the automated deployment of infrastructure and application code
at scale.

### Statistics Canada ‚òÅÔ∏è

#### Data Science Division

##### January 2022 - October 2022

###### Cloud Application Architect II

As a cloud application architect at Statistics Canada, I am responsible for
designing and implementing enterprise scale software solutions. A large part
of my role is working amongst a development team to design, develop, and
maintain the Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW). I continually am learning
about and leveraging Cloud technologies such as ArgoCD, Argo Workflows,
Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, and of course Kubernetes to design and deploy
features empowering Data Scientists with programming tools.

### JMP Solutions ü§ñ

#### AGV Division

##### August 2020 - December 2021

###### Lead Software Developer

As the lead software developer at the AGV division my role constantly evolved
with the technology. The term ‚ÄòAGV‚Äô means automated guided vehicles, not be
be confused with ‚ÄòAMR‚Äô meaning autonomous mobile robot. I worked primarily
with AMRs alongside a team or individually to commission complex systems on
site. An important part of my job was being a software architect: finding
ways to design fleet management and facility integration tools in order to
streamline the project lifecycle. I was constantly designing, improving and
commissioning software solutions across projects, while also acting as a
technical lead on AMR projects.

#### Controls Division

##### May 2019 ‚Äì December 2019

###### Software Developer

During my 8 month co-op at JMP, I was tasked with a variety of challenges.
Much of what I needed to do for my projects had not been done before. First
off, I devised and implemented an asset tracking database using Sharepoint
with a front-end Powerapps application for managing asset control in JMP‚Äôs
warehouse. I built a reusable project in Ignition‚Äôs platform utilizing Python
scripting. This software was implemented in a variety of projects successfully,
and is currently running in high demand 24/7 automation facilities! I
commissioned a multi autonomous mobile robot (AMR) system for an automotive
client. This system was required to delivery parts to the assembly line. I
gained valuable experience troubleshooting AMRs on site while systems were
running. Lastly, as a first responder to client issues, I maintained a line
of contact between suppliers and the client. As a result of the challenges my
team and I overcame during one of our projects, we received an innovation award.

### Self Employed üë®‚Äçü¶∞

#### Consulting

##### May 2018 ‚Äì June 2019

###### Software Developer I

While working with a colleague we have reached out to a machining company to
design an ERP system through the programming and design of an android
application to monitor shop data in real time. Using Microsoft Powerapps, we
designed a front end application connected to a custom Sharepoint table. We
produced a tablet client and a mobile client for viewing a dashboard summary
of the database.

### Cemcorp Ltd ‚öôÔ∏è

#### Headquarters

##### January 2018 - August 2018

###### Co-op Mechanical Engineering Student

At Cemcorp I worked with a team of engineers to solve engineering consulting
problems related to the process industry. I was tasked with work regarding
projects for Cemcorp‚Äôs clients, and internal projects on an as needed basis
by Cemcorp. In the 8 months at Cemcorp I collaborated with the team to help
lead an ISO9001:2008 to ISO9001:2015 standard transition, drafted P&ID‚Äôs and
PFD‚Äôs using both AutoCAD 2D and Plant 3D, was exposed to site visits at
plants in the industry, and aided in web development by consulting with the
Cemcorp team to design [Installcorp's website](http://installcorp.ca).
In addition, I was exposed to
the CRN industry and became familiar with many provincial jurisdiction‚Äôs
application requirements. Cemcorp gave me valuable experience in the
engineering consulting field, further developing my interpersonal skills, and
honing my technical skills in a variety of different softwares.

### Ontario Provincial Parks üèûÔ∏è

#### Bronte Creek Provincial Park Pool

##### June 2017 - September 2017

###### Assistant Pool Supervisor

Once I secured the position of Assistant Pool Supervisor I was a part of the
interviewing process for lifeguards, ensured training was being run smoothly
and effectively, evaluated all lifeguards performance through first aid
examinations, and gave performance reviews to the lifeguards. My experience
at Bronte was great for developing my interpersonal skills, and getting used
to working in a leadership role in a high stress environment.

##### June - September, 2014, 2015, 2016

###### Senior Lifeguard

For my first three years at Bronte I worked as a Senior Lifeguard. During my
years in this role I was part of a team of 20 lifeguards and was responsible
for running training, closing the pool, preparing competitions, lifeguarding
shifts, and I often took initiative to help with pool maintenance tasks due
to my mechanical inclinations.

## Education üè´

### University of Guelph üìú

#### Graduate School

##### August 2020 - October 2022

###### MASC+AI in Engineering

Throughout my mechanical engineering degree at UofG, I developed a passion
for software development. Whether it was working on personal or professional
software projects, I found I always had the same feeling of satisfaction
building applications from the ground up. I accepted admission to UofG to
pursue a MASC + AI. The ‚Äò+AI‚Äô designation indicates that my program has a
strong focus in artificial intelligence, as the University of Guelph is
affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/clients/university-of-guelph).
I studied Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning and how
it could be applied to autonomous vehicle platoon control. My thesis can be
found [here](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/27063), and I
published my research [here](https://intellrobot.com/article/view/4885).

#### Undergraduate School

##### September 2015 - April 2020

###### Bachelor of Engineering Co-op, Mechanical Engineering

The University of Guelph has been a great university for pursuing a degree
that I enjoy. Through being a part of many teams in projects, clubs, and the
classroom I have developed to become both a better person and better
engineering student. I have maintained a position on the Dean‚Äôs list
throughout my degree, and hope to until I graduate. For a year of my degree I
ran the Guelph Robotics Team as Co-President with my friend. This experience
allowed me to apply course concepts and provide leadership to incoming
students and current students at the university. I will always be grateful
for my university experience and the technical and transferrable skills it
has imparted in me.
