#### MASC+AI in Engineering

Throughout my mechanical engineering degree at UofG, I developed a passion
for software development. Whether it was working on personal or professional
software projects, I found I always had the same feeling of satisfaction
building applications from the ground up. I accepted admission to UofG to
pursue a MASC + AI. The â€˜+AIâ€™ designation indicates that my program has a
strong focus in artificial intelligence, as the University of Guelph is
affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/clients/university-of-guelph).
I studied Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning and how
it could be applied to autonomous vehicle platoon control. My thesis can be
found [here](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/27063), and I
published my research [here](https://intellrobot.com/article/view/4885).

### September 2015 - April 2020

#### Bachelor of Engineering Co-op, Mechanical Engineering

The University of Guelph has been a great university for pursuing a degree
that I enjoy. Through being a part of many teams in projects, clubs, and the
classroom I have developed to become both a better person and better
engineering student. I have maintained a position on the Deanâ€™s list
throughout my degree, and hope to until I graduate. For a year of my degree I
ran the Guelph Robotics Team as Co-President with my friend. This experience
allowed me to apply course concepts and provide leadership to incoming
students and current students at the university. I will always be grateful
for my university experience and the technical and transferrable skills it
has imparted in me.
