#### Co-op Mechanical Engineering Student

At Cemcorp I worked with a team of engineers to solve engineering consulting
problems related to the process industry. I was tasked with work regarding
projects for Cemcorp’s clients, and internal projects on an as needed basis
by Cemcorp. In the 8 months at Cemcorp I collaborated with the team to help
lead an ISO9001:2008 to ISO9001:2015 standard transition, drafted P&ID’s and
PFD’s using both AutoCAD 2D and Plant 3D, was exposed to site visits at
plants in the industry, and aided in web development by consulting with the
Cemcorp team to design [Installcorp's website](http://installcorp.ca).
In addition, I was exposed to
the CRN industry and became familiar with many provincial jurisdiction’s
application requirements. Cemcorp gave me valuable experience in the
engineering consulting field, further developing my interpersonal skills, and
honing my technical skills in a variety of different softwares.
