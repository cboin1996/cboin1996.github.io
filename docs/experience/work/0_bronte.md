#### Assistant Pool Supervisor

Once I secured the position of Assistant Pool Supervisor I was a part of the
interviewing process for lifeguards, ensured training was being run smoothly
and effectively, evaluated all lifeguards performance through first aid
examinations, and gave performance reviews to the lifeguards. My experience
at Bronte was great for developing my interpersonal skills, and getting used
to working in a leadership role in a high stress environment.

#### Senior Lifeguard

For my first three years at Bronte I worked as a Senior Lifeguard. During my
years in this role I was part of a team of 20 lifeguards and was responsible
for running training, closing the pool, preparing competitions, lifeguarding
shifts, and I often took initiative to help with pool maintenance tasks due
to my mechanical inclinations.
