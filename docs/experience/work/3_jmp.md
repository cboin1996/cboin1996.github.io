## AGV Division

### August 2020 - December 2021

#### Lead Software Developer

As the lead software developer at the AGV division my role constantly evolved
with the technology. The term â€˜AGVâ€™ means automated guided vehicles, not be
be confused with â€˜AMRâ€™ meaning autonomous mobile robot. I worked primarily
with AMRs alongside a team or individually to commission complex systems on
site. An important part of my job was being a software architect: finding
ways to design fleet management and facility integration tools in order to
streamline the project lifecycle. I was constantly designing, improving and
commissioning software solutions across projects, while also acting as a
technical lead on AMR projects.

## Controls Division

### May 2019 â€“ December 2019

#### Software Developer

During my 8 month co-op at JMP, I was tasked with a variety of challenges.
Much of what I needed to do for my projects had not been done before. First
off, I devised and implemented an asset tracking database using Sharepoint
with a front-end Powerapps application for managing asset control in JMPâ€™s
warehouse. I built a reusable project in Ignitionâ€™s platform utilizing Python
scripting. This software was implemented in a variety of projects successfully,
and is currently running in high demand 24/7 automation facilities! I
commissioned a multi autonomous mobile robot (AMR) system for an automotive
client. This system was required to delivery parts to the assembly line. I
gained valuable experience troubleshooting AMRs on site while systems were
running. Lastly, as a first responder to client issues, I maintained a line
of contact between suppliers and the client. As a result of the challenges my
team and I overcame during one of our projects, we received an innovation award.
