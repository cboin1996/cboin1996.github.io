#### Software Developer I

While working with a colleague we have reached out to a machining company to
design an ERP system through the programming and design of an android
application to monitor shop data in real time. Using Microsoft Powerapps, we
designed a front end application connected to a custom Sharepoint table. We
produced a tablet client and a mobile client for viewing a dashboard summary
of the database.
