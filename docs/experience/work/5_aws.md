#### Cloud Application Architect II

As a cloud application architect at AWS, I am responsible for gathering
customer requirements and building cloud applications.
I use the full power of AWS cloud to achieve this goal.
Specifically, my work involves requirements gathering, solutions design,
development, and the automated deployment of infrastructure
and application code at scale. In addition, acting as a project lead,
I am responsible for the assignment and tracking of project deliverables: from
managing agile development teams to developing proposed architectures on time
and in a cost effective manner.
