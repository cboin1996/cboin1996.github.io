#### Cloud Application Architect I

As a cloud application architect at AWS, I am responsible for gathering
customer requirements and building cloud applications that meet them.
I use the full power of AWS cloud to achieve this goal.
My work involves developing cloud applications
including the automated deployment of infrastructure and application code
at scale.
