#### Cloud Application Architect II

As a cloud application architect at Statistics Canada, I am responsible for
designing and implementing enterprise scale software solutions. A large part
of my role is working amongst a development team to design, develop, and
maintain the Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW). I continually am learning
about and leveraging Cloud technologies such as ArgoCD, Argo Workflows,
Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, and of course Kubernetes to design and deploy
features empowering Data Scientists with programming tools.
