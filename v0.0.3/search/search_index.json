This project on test day was timed by hand to achieve 15.59 seconds for the sort, and in other tests it could achieve times a bit over 14 seconds. This time is close to the limit set by the servo\u2019s ability to rotate to the cuts quickly, and human loading speed.

This time I decided it was time to begin budgeting. My first iteration of a budgeting solution was to manually input transactions by store, expense and amount in an iOS app. The iOS app would push the data to an SQL backend , powered by a PHP script hosted off of this website. I used this app for around a year, but eventually decided it was too much work and too error prone to manually input data. Next, I decided to recreate the app as a desktop CLI application. ShowMeTheMoney works by taking CSV data as input from bank websites. It parses the data into income and expenses, and then instructs the user to categorize each transaction\u2019s store with expenses. As the app gains more information, it then can reference the database to further automate data imports. Data is presented to the user via python bar charts, plotting their budgeted amounts versus amounts remaining by month, year or both.</p>"}]}
